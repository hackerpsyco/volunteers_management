# CLEAR BROWSER CACHE - IMPORTANT

The new code is deployed. You're seeing the OLD cached version.

## Step 1: Clear Browser Cache Completely

### Option A: Chrome/Edge/Firefox
1. Press: **Ctrl+Shift+Delete** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+Delete** (Mac)
2. Select: "All time"
3. Check: "Cookies and other site data" + "Cached images and files"
4. Click: "Clear data"
5. Close browser completely
6. Reopen browser

### Option B: Incognito/Private Mode
1. Open new Incognito/Private window
2. Go to your app URL
3. Test if c) button shows

### Option C: Hard Refresh (May not work if cache is persistent)
1. Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

## Step 2: Verify New Code Loaded

After clearing cache, go to feedback page and you should see:
- ✅ Page title: "Student Homework Feedback"
- ✅ ONLY the homework section (no tabs A, B, C)
- ✅ "Add Homework" button
- ✅ Clean, simple interface

## If Still Showing Old Page

1. Check browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Clear all storage:
   - Local Storage
   - Session Storage
   - Cookies
4. Close and reopen browser

The new code is 100% in place. It's just browser cache showing old version.
